<h2> align = "center>Number guess by checks</h2>
<hr>

<p>In this game we first set up the checks to find the number and each time you predict the wrong number checks decrease until you win the game or checks may be over before finding.</p>
<p>After winning or predicting the number a pop up showed to the screen that you have won the game</p>
<p>This game is just for learning the purpose of JS and does not provide the proper stability</p>
